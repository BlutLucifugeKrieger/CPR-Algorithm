This repository contains an algorithm that is capable to calculate the relative error of a laminar flow and turbulent flow depends on a the roughness and reynolds values


## What should i know before running the program?
First of all, check your current python version to avoid issues while the program is running,
if your are wondering what kind of libraries you need to have to run this program, we listed all of this just right here!:

 * Python version -> 3.11 or 3.12
 * SciPy version -> 1.11.4
 * Numpy version -> 1.26.0
 * Matplotlib -> 3.8.2

## How to use?

Well, to execute this program you need to clone this repository and after that, you should to open this project using a Python IDE or you can execute this project using the command prompt

### First case -> using an IDE (Pycharm)

## Program execution

Using the Pycharm IDE we got this:

After that, you can choose a function to evaluate using the keyboard, for example we select the first one (Churchill function)

**Note:** as you can see, the number typed using the keyboard appears in green color

And using the command prompt we got this:
